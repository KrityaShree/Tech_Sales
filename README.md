# NPS Prediction Project
This project was done from April 2023 to May 2023

## Objective
The objective of this project is to develop a logistic regression model for predicting if a sales rep will score an NPS of 9 or more using data from employees in the software product group with a college degree.

## Summary
- Explored logistic regression, Random Forest and SVM algorithms for NPS prediction.
- Logistic regression showed an accuracy ranging from 80% to 82%, with Model 3 having the highest accuracy of 82%.
- Random Forest and SVM did not outperform logistic regression, achieving maximum accuracies of 80.36% and 80.80% respectively.
- Interaction terms were included in some models to capture non-linear relationships, but did not significantly improve performance.
- Oversampling technique effectively improved the model's ability to predict high NPS scores.

## Key Metrics
- Logistic Regression: Accuracy ranged from 80% to 82%, with Model 3 achieving the highest accuracy.
- Random Forest: Maximum accuracy of 80.36%.
- SVM: Maximum accuracy of 80.80%.

## Conclusion
- Logistic regression provided the most interpretable results and had good performance in predicting high NPS scores.
- Random Forest also showed promise in predictive power.
- Addressing class imbalance through oversampling improved model performance.

## Future Work
- Further explore feature engineering and interaction terms to improve model performance.
- Experiment with different algorithms and ensemble methods.
- Investigate additional data sources or variables for better prediction accuracy.
